            <p>Are you tired of having boring, single-colored eyes?</p>
            <p>Here at Melumi Eyes, our team of genius scientists have worked day and night to bring you the latest in colored eye technology. Our latest breakthrough in eye tech allows our customers to not only be able to change their eye color at will, but also obtain the power to completely ignore racial differences, seeing everybody the same way.</p>

            <span>In reality, no one is immune from racial bias. Everyone's view of the world is at least partially based on race. There is no such thing as racially impartial and nobody is free from their prejudices. Humans evolved this way to keep themselves safe, and no technology exists in the world that can remove prejudice. As famous writer Kan Gao once remarked, "I think all our memories, and everything in it… can be nothing but the fiction we tell ourselves."</span>

            <p>If you're worried about whether our product is right for you, have no fear. No matter if you're a kind-hearted philanthropist or just a common man who doesn't want to be called racist, these eyes are perfect for you. We promise that with our iColor, you will never have to fear confrontations with people of other races ever again, and you will be able to treat them with respect.</p>
            <p>Gone are the days where you were afraid of offending people, not knowing what you did wrong. For just a small fee, your life can be free of worry forever.</p>

            <span>What we humans “see” isn’t like a raw image captured by a camera, but input heavily processed by our brain, merging images from both eyes, filling in details, and making lots of guesses. Our perception is generated by our brains, and not the literal light waves hitting our retinas. Therefore, what people “see” is subject to their beliefs, and what they have been taught. This also allows for change, but no technology can do that for you. Many people, especially white people, can’t see the small microaggressions that they commit in their daily lives, and a pair of new eyes won't change that, as the real culprit is the brain. Even through art depicting struggle and death, people's opinions are not easily changed.</span>

            <p>Here is a demo of the iColor. As you can see, we support a variety of colors, ranging from all skin tones to any color you can imagine! Our demo eye shows brown, yellow/orange, green/blue, and white/grey iris colors.</p>

            <span>This animation shows that all eyes see color, and that art is not enough to change how we think. It has already been established that everyone has racial bias, and the color-changing eye changes colors, representing the seeing of race and how we don’t see everyone as equal. Our inclinations change depending on the skin color of who we are interacting with.
            <br>
            If you're interested in the iColor, perhaps you've already tried exposing yourself to art that fights racism. Even though it is a good way to spread the message, art is rarely able to actually change someone's beliefs. At most, art can show things that usually aren’t seen, such as framing a microaggression that occurs in daily life. <!-- Art like this has caused Charles to feel very strongly about collecting art exposing racism against African Americans, in an effort to help the cause. However, the art didn’t change his core beliefs, as he still commits minor microaggressions and doesn’t really understand until Charlotte singles him out at the end of the play. Just viewing and buying art doesn’t have the same effect as Alex taking to the streets and meeting people, for example.--></span>

            <span>In digital art, such as the 3D creation software I use, I can change the color of people’s eyes. I can change the color of someone’s skin. I can control everything. I can even put this art on a website and spread it to people all over the internet, but art can’t change real people's beliefs, the prejudice ingrained through their upbringing. Art may be able to expose injustice and spread awareness, but compared to experiencing these events in real life or having them happen to you, art and words only serve to distance the viewer from reality.</span>
